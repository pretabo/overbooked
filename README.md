## Development and Debugging

### Logging

The game uses a comprehensive logging system that logs to both the console and log files. Log files are stored in the `logs` directory with timestamps in their filenames.

Log levels:
- `DEBUG`: Detailed development information
- `INFO`: General information about game operations
- `WARNING`: Warnings about potential issues
- `ERROR`: Error conditions
- `CRITICAL`: Critical errors that require immediate attention

### Debug Menu

The game includes a debug menu accessible from the main UI. This menu provides various tools for testing and debugging:

1. **Game State**: View and export game state, check wrestler details
2. **Performance**: Run tests on match and promo engines, view performance statistics
3. **Console Capture**: View real-time console output within the UI

To use the debug menu, click on the "[DEBUG] Debug Menu" button in the main navigation.

### Game State Debugging

For more detailed game state information, you can use functions provided in the `game_state_debug.py` module:

```python
import game_state_debug

# Print a summary of the current game state
game_state_debug.print_game_summary()

# Print detailed information about a specific wrestler
game_state_debug.print_wrestler_details(wrestler_id)

# Export the entire game state for debugging
game_state_debug.export_debug_state()
```

## Testing

The game includes extensive test suites for the match engine, promo system, and other components. You can run specific tests using the scripts in the `scripts` directory.

For example:
```
./scripts/promo-test     # Test the promo system
./scripts/overbooked     # Run the main game
```

## Architecture

The codebase is organized into several key components:

- **Match Engine**: `match_engine.py`, `match_engine_utils.py`
- **Promo System**: `promo/` directory
- **UI Components**: `ui/` directory
- **Game State**: `game_state.py`
- **Diplomacy System**: `diplomacy_system.py`, `diplomacy_hooks.py`
- **Database Utilities**: `db/` directory
- **Debugging Tools**: `game_state_debug.py`

## Database Structure

The game uses SQLite databases for data persistence:

- `wrestlers.db`: Wrestler profiles, attributes, and stats
- `relationships.db`: Relationships between wrestlers
- `save_state.db`: Game state information like current date
- `manoeuvres.db`: Wrestling moves and finishers
