# Promo Display Formatting Fixes

This document outlines the changes made to fix the wrestling promo display formatting to ensure consistency across all beats.

## Problem

The promo display had inconsistent formatting for different types of beats, particularly in versus promos:
- The intro beat was added twice
- Some beats were incorrectly marked as intro or summary beats
- The formatting of the promo lines was inconsistent
- Commentary and momentum/confidence scores weren't displayed consistently

## Solution

We made the following changes to fix the issues:

### 1. Created a custom commentary engine

Created a new file `promo/custom_commentary_engine.py` with:
- An improved `fixed_generate_commentary` function that properly identifies intro and summary beats
- Consistent commentary generation for all types of beats

### 2. Updated the `PromoDisplayWidget` class

Modified `ui/promo_test_ui.py` to:
- Use the new `fixed_generate_commentary` function instead of the original one
- Ensure consistent styling for all promo beats

### 3. Fixed the `format_versus_promo_for_display` method

Updated the method to:
- Properly mark intro and summary beats
- Skip duplicate intro beats
- Apply consistent styling to all beat types

## Consistent Format

All promo beats now follow this consistent format:

```
Wrestler Name: 
'Promo line text'. 
Commentary on the exchange. 
âš¡ 34.6 | ðŸ’ª 59.6 
```

With:
1. Wrestler name in their color
2. Promo line in single quotes
3. Commentary on the exchange
4. Momentum (âš¡) and confidence (ðŸ’ª) scores

## Files Modified

1. `promo/custom_commentary_engine.py` (New file)
2. `ui/promo_test_ui.py`
   - Imported custom commentary engine
   - Updated `display_next_beat` method
   - Fixed `format_versus_promo_for_display` method

## Testing

Several test scripts were created to validate the changes:
- `debug_promo_beats.py` - Logs raw beat data for debugging
- `fix_promo_display.py` - Tests the fixed formatting
- `log_promo_display.py` - Logs the formatted output to a file

The output now consistently shows the correct format for all beats in both single and versus modes.
