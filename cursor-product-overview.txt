## PRODUCT OVERVIEW
Overbooked is a comprehensive wrestling promotion management simulator that combines the creative elements of booking wrestling shows with the business management aspects of running a successful promotion.

## CORE FEATURES

### Wrestler Management
- The game features an extensive wrestler database system that maintains detailed information on each performer's physical attributes, in-ring abilities, personality traits, and crowd appeal, with more than 28 distinct statistics that determine performance across technical execution, psychology, charisma, and physical capabilities.
- Players can create custom wrestlers with a sophisticated creation system that allows for detailed customization of appearance, moveset, personality, and backstory, enabling the building of a unique roster that fits the player's promotional vision.
- The contract management system simulates the real-world complexity of talent relations, including salary negotiations, exclusivity clauses, creative control provisions, and appearance frequency requirements that impact both wrestler satisfaction and the promotion's budget.
- Wrestler development happens organically through match experience, with performers improving skills based on match types, quality of opponents, and crowd reception, allowing players to strategically book matches that develop specific areas of talent.

### Match System
- The match engine simulates realistic wrestling contests with dynamic pacing, momentum shifts, and signature moments that reflect each wrestler's unique style and capabilities, creating matches that feel authentic to the personalities involved.
- Players can book a variety of match types, from standard singles matches to complex multi-person stipulation matches, each with different rule sets that affect strategy, risk, and potential match quality based on the participants' specialties.
- The match quality system evaluates performance based on wrestler compatibility, build-up, match placement, and in-ring chemistry, providing detailed feedback that helps players understand what combinations create the most compelling entertainment.
- Post-match analysis tools provide comprehensive breakdowns of performance factors, crowd reaction, and narrative advancement, helping players refine their booking strategy for maximum entertainment value and storyline progression.

### Promo System
- The sophisticated promo engine allows wrestlers to engage in verbal confrontations that advance storylines and develop character, with outcomes determined by charisma stats, audience connection, and narrative context.
- Players can direct the general tone and content of promos while the system generates realistic dialogue that matches each wrestler's established character and current storyline positioning, maintaining consistency in character voice.
- Promo quality impacts crowd investment in storylines and can significantly affect the perceived value of upcoming matches, creating a compelling interplay between verbal segments and in-ring action that mirrors real-world wrestling programming.
- Special promo types like championship celebrations, retirement speeches, and surprise returns are available as booking options, each with unique mechanics and audience impact potential that can dramatically shift show momentum.

- Venue management includes selecting appropriate arenas based on market size, rental costs, and production capabilities, with the potential to build owned venues as a long-term investment strategy for established promotions.
- The financial system tracks revenue streams (ticket sales, merchandise, media rights) and expenses (talent contracts, venue costs, production) with detailed reports that help players understand their promotion's fiscal health and growth trajectory.
- Media rights negotiations become available as the promotion grows, simulating the real-world importance of television and streaming deals with factors like exclusivity, production requirements, and audience metrics affecting contract value.
