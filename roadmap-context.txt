    WRESTLING SIMULATOR – REMAINING FEATURE ROADMAP
    =================================================
    This document outlines the remaining core features and systems to be implemented in the wrestling simulator. It is written in a format designed for direct use with Cursor AI or similar tools for structured implementation planning. All features are presented in kayfabe – the game treats wrestling as a legitimate competitive sport.

    ================================
    CORE SIMULATION & EVENT LOGIC
    ================================
    Buff System Engine:
        - Implement a system that allows wrestlers to receive buffs or debuffs triggered by in-game events.
        - Each buff will have an activation condition, a stat effect (e.g. +10% stamina recovery), and a cooldown before reactivation.
        - Buffs affect wrestler behaviour or stats in matches, promos, or diplomacy.
    
    Match Interruptions:
        - Add mechanics where wrestlers can interfere in ongoing matches, either as scripted events or as impromptu surprises based on ongoing feuds.
        - The system should support both run-ins and full multi-person match transitions.
    
    Cheating Mechanics:
        - Wrestlers can attempt to cheat during matches (low blows, holding ropes, foreign objects).
        - The referee has a chance to detect and penalise based on bias, awareness, or alignment.
        - Player is occasionally prompted to respond to a caught cheat: allow, disqualify, or restart match.
    
    Impromptu Segments:
        - Matches and promos may occur spontaneously during shows due to backstage tensions, rivalries, or crowd energy shifts.
        - These should override or insert themselves into the scheduled event card, requiring player response.
    
    Promo Hijacking & Requests:
        - Wrestlers can request promo time or forcibly take it (especially if heel or angry).
        - Requests are influenced by rivalries, momentum, and past booking.
        - Player can approve, deny, or delay the segment.
    
    Event Flow Engine:
        - Dynamically alter events in progress. Matches may be cut short, segments may be skipped or reordered due to time constraints or backstage drama.
        - Integrates impromptu and interruption systems and tracks cause/effect.
    
    Player Decision Hooks:
        - Add prompts during events where the player must decide how to respond to unexpected events (e.g. intervene in a beatdown, approve an unbooked promo).

    ================================
    MATCH ENGINE ENHANCEMENTS
    ================================
    Referee AI:
        - Referees track legal/illegal actions and make independent decisions based on bias, alignment, or match psychology.
        - Some referees might miss or ignore cheating attempts.
    
    Match Strategy Layer:
        - Before the match, player or AI selects a strategy (technical, aggressive, crowd-pleaser).
        - Strategy influences move selection and affects stamina, crowd reaction, and quality.
    
    Spotlight System:
        - Automatically detect and flag high-drama moments (big reversals, comebacks, rare moves) for highlight reels.
        - Affects match ratings and post-show reports.
    
    Cheating & Drama Detection:
        - Track dramatic swings such as multiple false finishes or comebacks.
        - Contributes to match quality score and audience heat level.
    
    Effort, Psychology & Flow Metrics:
        - Expand match reports to show depth metrics: effort level, pacing quality, flow strength, synergy between performers.

    ================================
    PROMO SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS
    ================================
    Segment Types:
        - Support for solo monologue, face call-outs, heel interruptions, and full-on confrontations.
        - Segment type affects possible crowd and wrestler reactions.
    
    Beat-by-Beat Flow:
        - Promos progress through multiple talking beats and response cues.
        - Each beat can gain or lose crowd support, affect morale, or trigger interruptions.
    
    Promo Trigger System:
        - Internal system tracks wrestler emotion, popularity, and rivalries.
        - Triggers promos dynamically (e.g. “Wrestler X wants to respond to being attacked last week”).
    
    Interruption & Crowd Risk:
        - Promos are rarely uninterrupted. System allows organic interruptions that build or derail segments.
        - Player must decide whether to allow an interruption or intervene.
    
    Post-Promo Outcomes:
        - Promos affect wrestler heat, crowd mood, morale, and ongoing storylines.
        - Strong promos can initiate feuds, boost match interest, or influence faction dynamics.

    ================================
    STORYLINE & BOOKING SYSTEMS
    ================================
    Dynamic Segment Flow:
        - Ability to leave some show segments unbooked, allowing the system to insert impromptu promos or matches.
        - Player can still override or reschedule segments mid-show.
    
    Storyline Tracker UI:
        - Visual tool showing long-term story arcs, current progress, characters involved, and expected resolution.
        - Flags plot inconsistencies or unfinished angles.
    
    Feud Heat System:
        - Tracks how “hot” a feud is based on segment quality, crowd reaction, betrayal intensity, and match outcomes.
        - Heat influences match quality and crowd anticipation.
    
    Angle Scripting Tool:
        - Book specific non-match angles (e.g. contract signings, backstage brawls).
        - Success influenced by charisma, feud context, and randomness.
    
    Narrative Continuity Engine:
        - Enforces kayfabe consistency across characters.
        - Automatically adjusts alignment if wrestler acts out of character too often (e.g. a face constantly using weapons).

    ================================
    BACKSTAGE DIPLOMACY & MORALE
    ================================
    Morale System:
        - Wrestlers have a morale value influenced by booking, injuries, respect, and locker room perks.
        - Low morale leads to poor performance or refusal to perform.
    
    Faction Buffs & Penalties:
        - Wrestlers in alliances or stables receive buffs when booked together.
        - Betrayals or neglect result in faction heat or morale drops.
    
    Promise & Request Tracker:
        - Every commitment to a wrestler (push, promo, title shot) is logged.
        - Failure to fulfil a promise has consequences: morale drops, allies turning, increased promo outbursts.
    
    Reputation & Respect Layer:
        - Veteran wrestlers expect deference, rookies seek exposure.
        - Hierarchies influence backstage politics and wrestler behaviour.
    
    Push & Spotlight Requests:
        - Wrestlers request pushes based on momentum and ego.
        - Denial may result in sulking, outbursts, or crowd appeals.
